# MacroMastery

[MacroMastery](http://macromastery-env.eba-umapubbq.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/) is a web application designed to assist AP Macroeconomics students in practicing Free-Response Questions (FRQs) and receiving immediate feedback, as there is a lack of resources specifically tailored for this purpose.

## Chatbot User Flow

To engage with the platform:
1. Navigate to 'Chatbots' and select 'FRQ Quizzer' to activate the chatbot.
2. Interact with the chatbot by typing or utilizing the microphone button. You can start by saying 'Hi!'.
3. Select a topic by its corresponding number. If you've forgotten the number associated with a topic, you can access the list under 'Course Overview'.
4. The chatbot will present a random question from the database based on your selected topic.
5. Provide your answer, and the chatbot will analyze it to determine its accuracy. It will also provide the official answer for reference.
6. The chatbot will ask if you'd like to continue practicing, and the process repeats.
